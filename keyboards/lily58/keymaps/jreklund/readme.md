# jreklund Lily58 keymap (WIP)

Heavily inspired by Manna Harbour Miryoku keybord layout.

* You get access to all keys in case you want some macro keys
* Toggle button to switch between Qwerty (default) and Colemak-DH
* Nav, mouse, symbol and function layers are identical to Miryoku
* Windows first (no configuration options)
* Misc layer for easy typing swedish letters åäö using EurKey
