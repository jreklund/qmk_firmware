# jreklund Lily58 keymap (WIP)

Heavily inspired by Manna Harbour [Miryoku][0] keybord layout.

* You get access to all keys in case you want some macro keys
* Toggle button to switch between Qwerty and Colemak-DH (default)
* Nav, mouse, symbol and function layers are (almost) identical to Miryoku
* Windows first (no configuration options)
* Swedish letters åäö accessible by using [EurKey][1]
* Custom code layer with mod tap keys
* Numbers are accessible on Row 4 to make typing passwords easier
